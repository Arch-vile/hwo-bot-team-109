// TODO: NOTE: Printing death point at simulation and at nostradamus do not match exactly... is it something to worry about?
		// version showing this error is tagged in git as v1.1 "deathpointMismatch". it opens two simulations windows
		
		
- make death point calculations one step forward and make paddle to move optimized by these two points
- for each loop make a end condition trigger to prevent eternal loops
- how to react to latency
- how to react if no messages are coming from server? should not be a problem as we have simulation. but paddle movement must be smart.
- move all config variables to constants
- find out what is this tick interval returned from interface
- should we be ready for unordered list of input messages?
